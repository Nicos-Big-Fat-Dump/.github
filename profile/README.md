## Hi there 👋

This repo is like that box full of random knick knacks you hid under the bed one time.

Basically, I use this to stash away the repos I don't want cluttering up my personal account's repo list.

Here you'd find repos I made for:
* Codecademy Notes/Projects
* Marcy Lab Assignments
* AllStarCode Projects

... and hopefully many more!

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
